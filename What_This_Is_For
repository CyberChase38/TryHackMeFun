This is something that I am deciding to do just for the fun of it! I am currently studying for my CompTia Security+, and while I am studying for it I want to define my 
skills in the cybersecurity realms. Sharpen my swords so to speak. With this repository, I will attempt to work from Learning the Fundementals, to Blue Team related 
stuff, and even Penetration testing related stuff. I think this would be an interesting and fun thing to do in my free time.
